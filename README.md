# Space-X
This environment is to do the Peer Graded Assignment.  Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) is a virtual lab environment used in this course
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, whereas other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to Space X being able to reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an another company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. In this lab, we will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
